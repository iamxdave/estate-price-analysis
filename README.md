<!-- ABOUT -->
## About 🤔
<p align="justify">
  Welcome to <b>Real Estate Price Analysis</b>, a web application that leverages machine learning models to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and floor. This project was developed as part of my data science journey and aims to provide accurate price predictions to help users make informed decisions in the real estate market.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage 💻
<p align="justify">
  The Real Estate Price Analysis application allows users to input various parameters such as location, area range, number of rooms, and floor to predict the prices of real estate properties using different machine learning models. The application also provides error analysis and visualizations to help users understand the model predictions better.
</p>

- User inputs:
  - Location
  - Area Range
  - Number of Rooms
  - Floor
  - Model Selection

- Features:
  - Prediction Results
  - Error Analysis
  - Data Visualization
  - Model Comparison

<br/>

<!-- VISUALIZATION -->
## Visualization :camera: with a guide 📙
<p align="justify">
  The application includes several visualizations to help users understand the predictions and the underlying data. These visualizations include bar charts, error charts, and grouped bar charts to compare actual prices with predicted prices across different models.
